            On the other hand, The Snowball Analytics demo portfolio exemplifies key user interface design principles, enhancing user experience to a high degree fulfilling the requirements of the following principles.
            Consistency: 
            maintains uniformity across its interface, with standardized headers, footers, navigation menus, colour schemes, and fonts. 
            Allows users to navigate the site intuitively
            By utilizing external stylesheets, Snowball Analytics ensures that similar content sections share a cohesive look and feel, reinforcing a seamless user experience. 

            Ease of Navigation:
            links and navigation sections in consistent locations, enabling users to access desired information with minimal effort. 
            Prominent links to essential pages, such as the home or dashboard, are available on every page, facilitating quick transitions. 
            Effective use of the CSS Box Model and display properties creates large, easily tappable links, accommodating users navigating with various devices, including mice, trackpads, or touchscreens. 
            Universal Usability: . 
            By implementing CSS Media Queries, Snowball Analytics creates a responsive web app that adapts seamlessly to any device, ensuring a consistent experience across all devices
            Additionally, the use of semantic HTML elements, such as header, footer, and article, enhances compatibility with screen readers, improving accessibility for visually impaired users. 
            Error Prevention: 
            minimizes user errors by providing clear guidance and constraints within the interface. For instance, when setting up categories and target allocations, the platform offers intuitive tools and instructions, making it less likely to make an error. 
            By adhering to HTML and CSS standards, the platform ensures that browsers handle any code errors gracefully, preventing unnecessary error messages from reaching the user.

          <a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com">
              <h2><u>Berkshire Hathaway</u></h2>
          </a>

          <p>
            This section of the page presents a critical analysis of Berkshire Hatahway. Our team realised that there were several key areas where the website falls short in terms of best practices, which happens to significantly impact user experience and overall effectiveness.
            Violations of Design Principles Our analysis revealed several violations of fundamental design principles, including:
            Consistency: This website lacks between-page consistency, as there is no navigation section which is replicated on each page. The headers, footers, and layout choices are also not consistent on each page, making it unappealing and making navigation confusing.
            Ease of Navigation: Users are not able to easily navigate the web app due to a lack of navigation tools. There are no single-click shortcuts other than links which redirect you outside of the home page of the website. There is no way to return back to the home without clicking the back arrow on the browser. 
            Universal Usability: The website exhibits significant accessibility issues. There are no images at all, and there are no CSS Media Queries, meaning that this website is poorly designed for mobile users.
            Visual Appeal: The overall design appears outdated and lacks visual appeal, which can negatively impact user engagement and brand perception.
            Recommendations To address these issues and improve the user experience, we recommend the following:
            Revamp Layout: Create a consistent grid-based for better organization and improve overall visual appearance.
            Enhance Navigation: Implement a clear and intuitive navigation menu with well-defined sections and sub-sections. Also, add a search bar for better navigation.
            Regular Updates: Regularly update the website with fresh content, fix broken links, and ensure all information is accurate and up-to-date.
            Visual Appeal: Add images, and more visual elements to the website to increase visual appearance.
