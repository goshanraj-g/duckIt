            <h4>‚úÖ Consistency ‚úÖ</h4>
            <h5>Maintains consistency by applying uniform design elements across its interface, such as standardized headers, footers, navigation menus, color schemes, and fonts. This uniformity helps users recognize patterns and predict behavior within the platform, reducing cognitive load. External stylesheets are utilized to ensure that content sections with similar purposes maintain a cohesive look and feel.</h5>

            <h4>‚úÖ Navigation ‚úÖ</h4>
            <h5>Ease of navigation is achieved by placing links and navigation menus in predictable locations throughout the site. Prominent links to essential pages, like the home and dashboard, are accessible on every page to ensure quick transitions. The CSS Box Model and display properties are effectively used to create large, easily tappable links, making the site functional for all devices.</h5>

            <h4>‚úÖ Usability ‚úÖ</h4>
            <h5>Universal usability is prioritized by ensuring the platform adapts to different devices and accessibility needs. CSS Media Queries make the web app responsive, maintaining functionality and aesthetics on screens of all sizes. Semantic HTML elements like header, footer, and article enhance compatibility with assistive technologies, such as screen readers, making the site more inclusive for users of all devices.</h5>

            <h5>To enhance consistency, adding visual feedback like hover states or animations for interactive elements can provide additional clarity. For navigation, adding a breadcrumb trail can help users orient themselves and track their location within the site. Conducting user testing with diverse audiences can reveal remaining gaps in universal usability and identify further opportunities for refinement.</h5>

            <h5>The overall design of the website appears outdated, which detracts from its ability to engage users and keep interest. With minimal visual elements and no images, the site lacks the professionalism expected from a global brand like Berkshire Hathaway. The outdated appearance can negatively affect brand perception and may lead users to question the company's commitment to modern practices.</h5>

            <h4>‚ùå Navigation ‚ùå</h4>
            <h5>The website struggles with providing users with an intuitive navigation experience. There are no single-click shortcuts to key sections, and users must rely on external links or browser tools to move around the site. For instance, returning to the home page requires clicking the browser's back arrow, which is both inconvenient and counterintuitive. This lack of clear navigation tools can frustrate users.</h5>

          <div class="team">
            <h4>‚ùå Usability ‚ùå</h4>
            <h5>Usuability is a huge weakness here. The absence of CSS Media Queries means the site is not responsive, resulting in a poor experience for mobile users. Also, the lack of images and the limited use of semantic HTML elements hinder accessibility for users with visual impairments or those relying on assistive technologies. Addressing these issues is critical to ensure that the website meets accessibility standards.</h5>

          <div class="team">
            <h4>üí° Improvement üí°</h4>
            <h5>First, the layout should be revamped using a consistent grid-based structure to enhance organization and create a modern, cohesive appearance. Second, a clear and intuitive navigation menu should be implemented, featuring well-defined sections, sub-sections, and a search bar for better usability. Finally, adding images, graphics, and other visual elements will enhance visual appeal and engage users.</h5>
